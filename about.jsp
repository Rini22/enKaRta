Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., is a global educational publisher with products that promote knowledge and learning. We provide timely, relevant, and trustworthy information and instructional products used in schools, universities, homes, libraries, and workplaces throughout the world.

In a world where questionable information is rampant, we provide products that inspire confidence, with content people can trust. We do this, as we have for many years, by collaborating with experts, scholars, educators, instructional designers, and user-experience specialists; by subjecting their work to rigorous editorial review; and by combining it all into learning products that are useful, reliable, and enjoyable.

We?re deeply involved with schools, parents, and educators, designing products for the 21st-century classroom and today?s home learning environments. We?re a pioneer in digital education, and our products are marked by engaging, reliable, and trustworthy content.

Many people know us as the publisher of those big multivolume encyclopedias that have been a source of joy and learning since 1768. Today that encyclopedia is chiefly to be found in a multitude of digital forms that are updated daily.

But we?re also much more than that today. We?ve changed and expanded.

Britannica is online, in e-books, and on mobile devices. Britannica is math, science, and social studies. Britannica is for the 2nd-grader learning math, the teacher explaining the laws of gravity, and the lifelong learner trying to understand the latest political crisis.
